<h1>A Virtual Pet isnpired by Digimons and Tamagotchis &#128050&#127918;</h1>

<h5>This is a really fun project of mine trying to replicate what would be a "digivice" for Koromon from Digimon Adventure</h5>
<p>Doing for pleasure and to learn a few gaming mechanics and usage of JS methods and functions</p>
<hr>

<div align="center">
  <p>All though there is a variety of assets available for making games of a such kind I'm also trying to do everything from scratch such as the digivice design and structure as well the sprites of the digimonster itself</p>

  <p>This has been a sugestion of an extra exercise from Professor Fabiano Moreira from Senac and I hope to conclude with at least minimal characteristics of the world phenomenon of Tamagotchis</p>
